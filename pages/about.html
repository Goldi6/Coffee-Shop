    <h2>welcome to Coffee Project!</h2>
    <p>This project is created to practice my web programming skills which were learned explicitly through the WWW.</p>
    <p>This webpage in NOT created for a real coffee shop, it was made for fun as a hobby.</p>
    <p>Here you can see a website, witch is responsive and has an adaptive design.<br> It has the option to create a table reservation through a form that allows you to reserve in a week from now and up to 3 months forward. After sending the form it will
        save the time and date to the local storage for display. There is also an option to clear all or one of the reservations made through this webpage from the client side view ('reserved' menu).
        <br>
        <p>All of the menu Item are dynamically generated from js objects</p>
        <p>It has an 'Events' scroll menu, which scrolls one element at a time.</p>
    </p>
    <p> Currently you can see here some ready stuff and some uncompleted functionality.
    </p>
