# Coffee Shop Website

This web project is made for practice and as part of my portfolio.
It uses Jquery , php and mysql.

_This coffee shop is not an existing business just for your notice._

To check out this project you may need a local server like XAMPP or WAMP , jquery is included within the project.

1. To create a database you should change the password and the username variable in 'db_userData.php' file if you've changed the default values in your localhost login details.

2. For database creation open the 'create_DB.php' file in your browser like so: http://localhost/ArtCaffee/create_DB.php if you placed the project directly in your htdocs or www folder. You should see confirmation msg if the generation was successful. ***(*no need for this commit)\***

**When you've installed and started the local server, open the **'index.php'** page with your browser in your **localhost** to view the webpage.**
**_(http://localhost/ArtCaffee/index.php)_**

\*_This webpage is in progress so there is some functionality wich may not work because it's not done yet._
